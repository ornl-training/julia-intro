Melissa and her schoolmates built a trebuchet in their physics club.  In their
first tests they experienced that aiming it is not that easy and intuitive, so
they are planning to write a program that automatically aims their trebuchet
given the distance of the target and the velocity of the wind.

As for the programming language, they chose Julia since it has state-of-the-art
packages for this task and they also read it composes very well.  Unfortunately
nobody knows this language already, so they have to learn it from scratch.
